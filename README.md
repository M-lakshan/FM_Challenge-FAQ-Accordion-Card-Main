# FM_Challenge-FAQ-Accordion-Card-Main
a simple web page of FAQs form of a responsive dropdown using HTML, CSS &amp; JS

After few months of practice in JS I managed to make a responsive toggling-dropdown. Thare are two JS files for each dropdown modes. Choose a preffered script and run the code - script1 is in if-else conditions &amp; script2 is in functions and methods.
There may be some errors or alternative ways for better functioning. I just wanted to make the dropdown part well responsive, rather than being 100% perfect in every way. Appriciate if you wish to share your ideas with me. Also Feel free to change the scripting &amp; use it as your own :)
